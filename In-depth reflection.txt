I began the assignment by analyzing the tasks carefully and started sketching out ideas for the assignment.
Firstly, I identified the Vehicle class as the main entity containing all the attributes and methods, I then began separating private attributes from public attributes for easier sorting and usage which are the base classes such as type, speed and getters for them. I then implemented objects as well as functionality to make the code work with basic user inputs allowing the user to input vehicle type, speed and fuel type.
Additionally, I enhanced the code with the display info method displaying the vehicle's basic info along with showcasing the vehicle's acceleration as a separate method. I carefully used CamelCase for class names and methods to make the code clean and readable and followed the principles of OOP. 
The assignment was a great learning experience, however it also came with difficulties and struggles for me. To begin with, the first struggle I encountered was implementing user inputs due to the assignment being different from the ones that have been assigned to me before only requiring to display a fixed into while this one required inputs from the user themselves. Secondly, I was not very familiar with separating the public and private class so I had to look at examples to understand how to use them effectively. The OOP concept played a big part of this code by bundling all the requirements of the tasks into one simple class representing encapsulation while also displaying necessary info via the abstraction method. 
I do believe the code still has potential for future development and refinement and serve as a great coding experience for me.
